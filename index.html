                This is an amazing open source software. Think of your folder is very clumsy, videos, docs, excel, text all are in the same place in the file. It will be very hard to manage. But using our open source app you can organize similar files with the same extension in one place. Think about it. It will be so easy to manage and search things. Just need to paste the location of the file that's all your file will be organized. Click on the heading to download.
